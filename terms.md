# Peermit Terms of Use

Please read these terms of service ("Terms") carefully as they form a
contract between you and Peermit.com. ("Peermit"). These Terms govern
your use of the Peermit "Service", which refers individually and
collectively to all written or electronic materials, data, text, audio
video, images or other content ("Content") and software made available
through the www.peermit.com website ("Site"). These Terms refer to the
individual or entity using the Service (including any component of the
Service) as "you".

By using the Service, visiting the Site, or registering for an account
with us, you are accepting and agreeing to these Terms, and the policies
and guidelines referenced in these Terms. These Terms require the use of
arbitration to resolve disputes on an individual basis, rather than jury
trials or on resolution a collective basis.

Provided the User is using the Peermit as a business customer, i.e. for
purposes of his or her trade, business or profession or on behalf of a
public body or corporation, article § 312e paragraph 1, sentence 1, no. 1
- 3 of the German Civil Code does not apply.

Peermit may amend these Terms at any time by posting the revised Terms
on the Site. Amended Terms take effect when posted to the Site,
when Peermit gives such notice, or when you, or when you otherwise
accept the amended Terms - whichever occurs first.

## 1. About Blockchains And The Peermit Service

### 1.1 Blockchain And Account Information.

The Service does not send or receive money and never has nor will every
have access to the tokens associated with your account or the accounts
itself.

As a service provider, Peermit enables you to secure your tokens against
intrusion into your systems. A customer will have a *secured account*
("account") that is associated with the email address provided by the
user.

By using the Service, instructions concerning your account's tokens
require approval by at least two authorities of which Peermit will be
only one. The other authority will be the customer himself. The Service
will make use of so called *Proposals* that request to execute some
instructions that affect your account's tokens. 

### 1.2 Proposal Procedure and Second-Factor-Authentication

In order to transfer tokens from your account, a proposal has to be
created that instruct a transfer and the Service as well as the customer
have to manually approve.

Peermit's approval solely depends on successful verification of the
proposers identity by means of Second-Factor-Authentication (2FA), e.g.
a link in an email sent to the owner of the account.

Once the blockchain network recognizes the proposal and the required
approvals from the Service and the customer are validated, the
instructions are executed. Neither other individuals or companies in the
network nor the Service cannot be used by you to cancel or reverse these
instructions.

The account is under sole control of the customer such that access to
the tokens is granted by removing the requirement of the Service's
approval. Hence, customers can freely *opt-out* of the Service. It is
the customer's responsibility to secure the so cryptographic *owner*
private key properly and verify the instruction of proposal before
approval.

### 1.3 Key Management.

Key Management distinguishes 

- account owner permissions (which control the account itself and its tokens), from
- account active, or spending permissions (which solely control the account's tokens)

Peermit does not control full or partial access to your account's owner
authority.

Peermit controls only one of the active authorities required to access
your account's tokens.

You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of the other
private keys associated with the spending permission and account owner
permission. In the event you appoint a third party to control one or
more of your private key(s), whether or not such appointment is made
through the Service (e.g, through a key recovery service), Peermit is
not responsible for the action or inaction of such third party.

### 1.4 Your Account.

Your individual accounts are your property and your responsibility.
Peermit cannot make transactions using your accounts except in
conjunction with a request or command through the Service. You can
opt-out from the service and keep your account by removing Peermit
authority from your permissions.

### 1.5 Third Party Applications.

If you grant express permission for a third party to connect to your
Peermit Service account, either through the third party's product or
through the Service, you acknowledge that granting permission to a third
party to take specific actions on your behalf does not relieve you of
any of your responsibilities under these Terms. Further, you acknowledge
and agree that you will not hold Peermit responsible for, and will
indemnify Peermit from, any liability arising from the actions or
omissions of this third party in connection with the permissions you
grant. You may change or remove these permissions from the account
settings page.

### 1.6 Taxes.

It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to any
transactions you make or receive, and it is your responsibility to
collect, report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax
authority. Peermit is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply
to your transactions, or for collecting, reporting or remitting any
taxes arising from any transactions.

### 1.6 Risks.

Peermit has no control over, and makes no representations regarding the
value of your tokens, or the security of the blockchain network. The
value of your tokens can change rapidly, increase or decrease
unexpectedly, and potentially even fall to zero. 

You acknowledge that participation in the blockchain network involves
risk.

A proposal may be unapproved by the Service for a period of time
(usually less than a few minutes, but up to three business days).

agreeing to these Terms for that organization and promising to Peermit
that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms (in
which event, "you" and "your" will refer to that organization).
Nevertheless, each individual that uses the Service or accepts these
Terms on behalf of an organization agrees that the permissions given to
Peermit under these Terms, and the restrictions and limitations to the
rights of persons and entities using the Service, apply to each such
individual. You may use the Service only in compliance with these Terms
and only if you have the power to form a contract with Peermit and are not
barred under any applicable laws from doing so.

### 5.7 Interpretation.

The section titles in these Terms and summary descriptions (labeled
"English") are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual
effect. These Terms will not be construed in favor of or against any
party by reason of the extent to which any party participated in the
drafting of these Terms. The failure of either party to insist upon or
enforce strict performance of any of the provisions of these Terms or to
exercise any rights or remedies under these Terms will not be construed
as a waiver or relinquishment to any extent of such party's right to
assert or rely upon any such provision, right or remedy in that or any
other instance; rather, the same will remain in full force and effect.
The word "or" as used in these Terms has the same meaning as "and/or".
The terms 'include' and 'including' will be deemed to be immediately
followed by the phrase "without limitation."

## 6. Jurisdiction

These Terms of Use shall be governed by German law. The application of
the German Uniform Code on the Formation of Contracts for the
International Sale of Movable Goods of 17 July 1973 and the United
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sales of Goods
(CISG) of 11 April 1980 is excluded.
