# Welcome to Peermit

Peermit.com offers the first of its kind second factor authentication
(2FA) software solutions for Graphene&trade; based blockchains (such as
BitShares, Steem, PeerPlays, and others) to secure accounts and
funds on the blockchain.

### What we do

We provide and customize a software solution for exchange, merchants and
institutional partners to implement and improved account security. [Read
about use-cases](/usecases).

We use Python to build enterprise-grade software that is scalable,
secure and truly reliable. Python is one of the most easily readable
high level programming languages which means that it can be easily read
and understood by our clients.

Our customers are service providers that want to improve the security of
their customers and offer an advantage over their competitors. We
provide them with the software to do so and assist them integrations and
improvements.

## Why Peermit

- **Modern Cryptography**

  Our technology uses *industry standards* of hierarchical
  threshold-signatures which are more powerful and flexible than
  traditional multi-sig schemes, such as
  [P2SH](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0016.mediawiki)
  as used in first-generation blockchain technologies.

- **Seamless Setup**

  Secure existing accounts with minimal effort. Just a few clicks in
  most user interfaces, and you are ready to go. Even more
  sophisticated setups can be easily implemented and cross-checked
  before going operational.

- **Secure**

  Our standard setup with 2-of-3 flat multi-signatures removes all
  single points of failure by using 3 keys: your reference account,
  your backup key and Peermit's co-signing key. Each transaction
  requires 2 keys for signing giving you full control. You can stop
  using our service by at any time since you are the **owner** of
  the account.

- **Layered Approval Security**

  For every pending transaction that requires co-signing approval, our
  clients define if they want *instantly* approval, require a
  *delay* or even *in-person* verification of the transaction.
  Furthermore, multiple co-signers can be required before a transaction
  can be executed successfully. Tell us your story, and we can customize
  a solution just for you!

- **Integrated Audit Trail**

  As Peermit.com is first to use on-chain proposals for negotiation
  with co-signers, the blockchain stores every attempt to gain access
  to your accounts, indefinitely and thus offers an intrinsic
  audit trail.

- **Multiasset Support**

  The basic package already supports transfers of any blockchain based
  asset.

- **Billing Options**

  The platforms offers multiple payment option such as, *prepaid*,
  *pay-as-you-go* or by monthly bills. The customer defines what fits
  his business needs best.

- **Additional Features**

  - **API**: An API allows seamless integration into any existing
    wallet architecture within minutes. The integration can be as
    simple as changing one line of code.

  - **Modern 2FA solutions**: Besides the option to confirm
    transactions via email, we can offer confirmations per 
    [mobile transaction verification numbers (mTAN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_authentication_number#Mobile_TAN_.28mTAN.29),
    [index TAN lists (iTAN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_authentication_number),
    [Google Authenticator (RFC 4226, RFC 6238)](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator), or
    [Universal 2nd Factor (U2F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor).

  -  **Proposals**: Some Graphene&trade;-based blockchains support
     [*proposals*](/help/proposal/) which make side channels to
     technically organize a multi-party transaction obsolete.

  - **Notifications**: Customers can be notified about any transaction
    that requires their approval on different communication channels,
    such as email, SMS, or instant messaging.

  - **KYC**: The service provider can (and may legally forced to)
    request identification material from its customers while the
    software supports these inqueries.
